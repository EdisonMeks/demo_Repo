 
 Ecplore what you don't know
 
 success is a journey not a destination
 you cannot know and appreciate the value of a fountain unless it dries up
 time is not wasted but he/she who does not use it is wasted
 
 reprove not a fool lest you get yourself insult, reprove a wise man and he shall appreciate you
 revile not at evil doers, just good works will heap burning coals on his head
 
 he that soweth wickedness reapeth eternal death
 he that soweth righteousness reapeth life eternal
 GOD is not mocked, you reap what you sow
 
 
 
 you can add more out of your experience
 

 so far we can pause from there

 ***** THE LIST IS ENDLESS *****

 success is a journey not a destination
 you cannot know and appreciate the value of a fountain unless it dries up
 time is not wasted but he/she who does not use it is wasted
 
 reprove not a fool lest you get yourself insult, reprove a wise man and he shall appreciate you
 revile not at evil doers, just good works will heap burning coals on his head
 
 
 
 you can add more out of your experience
